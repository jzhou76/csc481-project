Besides the {\bf Edit Distance} problem, we also finished two more problems.
One is the {\bf Longest Common Subexpression} problem and the other is
a made-up one that we call {\bf Primeness}. We discuss the three problems
and our solutions in the following three sections.

The source code of our solutions are available one
